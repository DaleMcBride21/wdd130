                    <b>Physicality of hunts:</b> 
                    As an outfitter, we understand the physical demands and challenges that come with hunting elk, deer, and moose. Our seasoned guides know the terrain like the back of their hands, leading hunters through rugged mountains, dense forests, and marshy landscapes in pursuit of these magnificent creatures. Tracking elk and deer requires traversing vast expanses of wilderness. Moose, with their sheer size, present their own set of challenges, requiring hunters to be prepared for thick brush and marshy terrain. Being in the right shape is very important in order to keep you safe and well and upping the chances of you having a successful hunt.

                    <b>Weather:</b> We as the outfitters cannot control the weather that we face here in Jackson. You as the guest need to be prepared with the proper gear for very cold climates. We suggest a layering system from a reputable brand. We prefer KUIU, but it is up to personal preference. Contact us if you have any questions about gear we recomend!

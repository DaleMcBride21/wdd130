                <p>Jackson "Ridge" Thompson, a native of Jackson, Wyoming, inherited his love for the wilderness from his father and grew up exploring the Teton Range. Skipping college, he pursued his passion for the outdoors and became a skilled hunter and tracker. Establishing Broken Antler Outfitters in his early twenties, Ridge gained a reputation for his ethical approach to hunting and dedication to wildlife conservation. Today, he continues to lead guided hunting trips, instilling in his clients a deep respect for the land and its inhabitants while advocating for the preservation of Jackson's natural heritage.</p>

                <p>Ridge's wife, Emily, grew up with a deep appreciation for the outdoors, and her love for nature matched Ridge's own. Meeting during a hunting trip in the Teton Range, they quickly realized they shared not only a passion for the wilderness but also a desire to make a difference in conservation. Emily's background in business management perfectly complements Ridge's outdoor expertise, allowing them to run Ridge's Edge Outfitters seamlessly together. With Emily handling logistics and Ridge guiding clients, they've created a successful outfitter business that prioritizes sustainable hunting practices and environmental stewardship. Together, they're not only partners in marriage but also in their shared mission to protect Jackson's natural heritage.</p>
